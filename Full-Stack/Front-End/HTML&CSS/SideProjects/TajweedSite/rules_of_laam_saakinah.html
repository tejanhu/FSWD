    Laam Saakinah Rules


    Note: All Laam Saakinah rules apply to Laam with Sukoon.





    Laam sukoon in a definite article (لَامُ التَّعْرِيْفِ)


    It is a laam saakinah added with a Hamzatul Wasl to an Arabic word i.e.: (ال).


    This Laam is split into two types:
    1a)The Lunar Laam and 1b) The Solar Laam

    These two types of Laams form two groups of letters which come after it and Hamzatul Wasl: Moon letters and Sun
    letters.


    The Lunar Laam will be pronounced with Al-Idh’haar “clearly”.

    The Solar Laam will be pronounced with Al-Idghaam “merging”.




    اللَّامُ القَمَرِيَّةُ (The Lunar Laam)


    1a. Al-Laam Al-Qamariyyah اللَّامُ القَمَرِيَّةُ (The Lunar Laam)

    This Laam is always written and pronounced, and a shaddah will never appear on the moon letter following it.


    Al-Idh’har will be applied i.e. you will pronounce the laam saakinah, so long as any of the following 14 moon
    letters follow it:
    ا ب غ ح ج ك و خ ف ع ق ي م ه


    These Moon letters have been grouped together in the following phrase to help memorise them:
    ابْغِ حَجَّكَ وَخَفْ عَقِيْمَهُ

    Examples:











    اللَّامُ الشَّمْسِيَّةُ (The Solar Laam)


    1b. Al-Laam Al-Shamsiyyah اللَّامُ الشَّمْسِيَّةُ (The Solar Laam)

    This Laam is always written, but is not pronounced, and a shaddah will appear on the sun letter following it.


    Al-Idhgaam will be applied i.e. you will not pronounce the laam saakinah, so long as any of the following 14 sun
    letters follow it:
    ت ث د ذ ر ز س ش ص ض ط ظ ل ن


    These Sun letters have been grouped together in the following phrase to help memorise them:
    طِبْ ثُمَّ صِلْ رَحِمً تَفُزْ ضِفْ ذَا نِعْمْ دَعْ سُوْءَ ظَنٍ زُرْ شَرِيْفًا لِلْكَرَمْ
