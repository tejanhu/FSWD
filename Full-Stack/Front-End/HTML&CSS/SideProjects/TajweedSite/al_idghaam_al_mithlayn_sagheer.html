    Al-Idghaam Mithlayn Sagheer الإِدْغَامُ مِثْلَيْنِ صَغِيْر (Small merging of the same letter)


    This is when you merge the Meem Saakinah into the voweled meem such that the Meem Saakinah is at the end of a word
    and the next word starts with a voweled meem.


    The Idghaam letter in this case is the second meem (voweled meem) which is emphasised with shaddah ( ّ ) giving
    ghunnah (nasal sound).

    You may find it easier to find this rule in your mushaf if your mushaf does not show a sukoon on the first meem.
    The only letter of Al-Idghaam Mithlayn Sagheer:

    م



    How to pronounce the Al-Idghaam Mithlayn Sagheer rule:

    Press your two lips together completely to pronounce a full meem and do this for an appropriate length of time.
