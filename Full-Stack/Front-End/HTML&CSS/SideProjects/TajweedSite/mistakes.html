        <p> The study of Tajweed is important because it ensures the reciter avoids “lahn” (mistakes or errors) in
            recitation.
            Mistakes or errors in the Qur’aan are known as lahn لَحْنٌ. They are divided into two categories:</p>
        <p> Lahn:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Lahn Jali لَحْنٌ جَلِيٌّ or clear/obvious error, such that it is clear for both a Tajwid expert and
                complete
                beginner.</li>
            <li>Lahn Khafi لَحْنٌ خَفِيٌّ or hidden error.</li>
        </ol>
        <p> Lahn Jali لَحْنٌ جَلِيٌّ or clear/obvious error: it is an error that occurs in the pronunciation of the word
            altering the shape of the word and meaning.</p>
        <p> E.g.1: Like reciting in Surat Al Fatiha, A)(أَنْعَمْتُ عَلَيْهِمْ) instead of B) (أَنْعَمْتَ عَلَيْهِمْ)
        </p>
        <ol>
            A)

            <li>This means: whom I blessed; relating the blessings to the reciter himself</li>
            B) <li>This means: whom You (Allah) blessed</li>
        </ol>
        <p> By simply changing the fatha to dhammah, this changes the meaning altogether which is “haraam” forbidden to
            do
            and
            may invalidate the prayer and if intentionally done can be an act of “kufr” disbelief.</p>
        <p> Lahn Jali لَحْنٌ جَلِيٌّ or clear/obvious error: it is an error that occurs in the pronunciation of the word
            altering the shape of the word and meaning.
        </p>
        <p> E.g.1: Like reciting in Surat Al Fatiha, A) (صِرَاتَ) instead of B)(صِرَاطَ)
        </p>
        <ol>
            A) <li>This is incorrect</li>
            B) <li> This is correct</li>
        </ol>
        <p> By simply replacing طَ with تَ, this changes the meaning altogether which is “haram” forbidden to do and may
            invalidate the prayer and if intentionally done can be an act of “kufr” disbelief
        </p>
        <p>

            Lahn Khafi لَحْنٌ خَفِيٌّ or hidden error: it is an error that occurs in the pronunciation of the word
            without
            altering the shape of the word and meaning, however, it is caused by mispronunciation of letters due to
            reading
            against the rules of Tajweed by either not fulfilling the obligatory “sifaat” properties of the letters, or
            by
            not
            being aware of the rulings for certain letters (heavy and light).</p>
        <p>
            This type of error can be known by a student or expert in Tajweed, and is unknown or hidden to a person who
            is
            unfamiliar with Tajweed.</p>
