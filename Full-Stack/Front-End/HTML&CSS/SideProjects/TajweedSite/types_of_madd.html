    Al-Madd (المَدُّ) Elongation/Lengthening

    There are 2 types of Madd, we will only be focusing on one type of Madd in this lesson

    Note: المَد الأَصْلِي Al-Madd Al-Asli (Original Elongation) and المَد الطَّبِعِي Al-Madd At-Tabee’i (Natural
    Elongation) mean the exact same thing.






    1. Al-Madd Al-Asli المَد الأَصْلِي (Original/Natural Elongation)
    2. Al-Madd Al-Far’ee المَدُّ الفَرْعِي (Secondary Elongation)
    Al-Madd Al-Muttasil
    Al-Madd Al-Munfasil
    Al-Madd Al-Badl
    Al-Madd Al-A’aridhu Lis-Sukooni
    Al-Madd Al-Laazim



    1. Al-Madd Al-Asli المَد الأَصْلِي (Original/Natural Elongation)

    Al-Madd means to increase, and refers to how long you lengthen certain letters


    There are three letters of Al-Madd, and the following word may help you memorise them (واي)
    و
    ا
    ي


    A fatha comes before an (ا) i.e.: قَالَ
    A kasrah comes before a (ي) i.e.: قِيْلَ
    A dhammah comes before a (و) i.e.: قُوْلُوْا


    Pronouncing the Madd letter correctly is an essential part of the word; otherwise it can lead to an alteration in
    the meaning of the word i.e.: وَلَدٌ means ‘boy/son’ and if we add an ( ا ) it becomes وَالِدٌ which means ‘father’


    Al-Madd Al-Asli is known as The Natural Elongation because it comes naturally when you naturally prolong the letters
    of Madd with a precise length of two vowel counts i.e.: reading (ا) or (و) or (ي) twice , without increasing or
    decreasing

    Example: يَقُوْلُ

    Examples:

    يَقُوْلُ٬ قِيْلَ٬ وَحِيْلَ٬ الَّذِي٬ صُدُوْرِ النَّاسِ٬ قَالَ٬ كَانَ٬ الصَّدَقَاتُ٬ المَسَاكِيْنِ٬ حُوْرٌ
    مَقْصُوْرَاتٌ فِي الخِيَامِ٬ يَطُوْفُ

    Exercise 1: Using the above information, identify what the letter of Al-Madd is in the following word and practise
    pronouncing it with Al-Madd

    (كَانَ) (قَالَ) (الَّذِي) (وَحِيْلَ) (قِيْلَ) (يَقُوْلُ)

    (الصَّدَقَاتُ) (المَسَاكِيْنِ) (يَطُوْفُ) (مُوْسَى)


    (صُدُوْرِ النَّاسِ) (حُوْرٌ مَقْصُوْرَاتٌ فِي الخِيَامِ) (عِيْسَى)


    Exercise 2: Identify what the letter of Al-Madd is in the following word and practise pronouncing it with Al-Madd

    (غُفْرَانَكَ) (غَفُوْرٍ رَّحِيْمٍ) (يُوْسُفَ) (يَقُوْلُوْنَ)

    (غُفْرَانَكَ) (غَفُوْرٍ رَّحِيْمٍ) (يُوْسُفَ) (يَقُوْلُوْنَ)

    (يَا صَالِحُ) (يُوْصِيْكُمْ) (لِإِيْلَافِ) (تُبْصِرُوْنَ) (إِنِّي) (إِنَّا) (فِيْهَا)



    2. Al-Madd Al-Far’ee المَدُّ الفَرْعِي (Secondary Elongation)

    Al-Madd Al-Far’ee is when we prolong the letters of Madd, but this type of elongation is longer than the previous
    (natural elongation)

    Natural Elongation Example:

    قَالَ


    Al-Madd Al-Far’ee(secondary elongation) Example:

    السَّمَاءُ

    With the natural elongation you have to elongate the letters of Madd for two vowel counts, it’s an obligatory
    elongation.

    However, Madd Al-Far’ee could either be :
    1) Al-Wujoobu الوُجُوْبُ (Obligatory)
    2) Al-Jawaazu الجَوَازُ (Permissible)
    3) اللَّازِمُ Al-Laazimu (Compulsory)
    When do we apply Al-Madd Al-Far’ee?


    We apply Al-Madd Al-Far’ee when there is either;

    Hamza coming after the elongation letter
    Hamza coming before the elongation letter
    Sukoon that comes after the elongation letter


    Al-Madd Al-Far’ee is split into two categories:

    A Madd that is caused by Hamza (There are three types of Madd that come under this section, which we will see later)
    A Madd that is caused by Sukoon (There are two types of Madd that come under this section, which we will see later)


    In total, there are five groups of Madd that come under a Madd caused by Hamza and Sukoon.



    We will first look at the three types of Madd that are caused by Hamza:

    Al-Madd Al-Muttasil المَدُّ المُتَّصِلُ (Connected Elongation)
    Al-Madd Al-Munfasil المَدُّ المُنْفَصِلُ (Disconnected Elongation)
    Al-Madd Al-Badl المَدُّ البَدَلُ (Change Elongation)

    1. Al-Madd Al-Muttasil المَدُّ المُتَّصِلُ (Connected Elongation) is when the Hamza comes after the Madd letter, and
    the Hamza and the Madd are in the same word and this is where the name ‘connected’ comes from i.e.: السَّمَاءُ


    Al-Madd Al-Muttasil المَدُّ المُتَّصِلُ (Connected Elongation) is an obligatory elongation where the reciter must
    prolong the elongation letter for a precise length of four to five vowel counts i.e.: reading (ا) or (و) or (ي) four
    or five times whether it is continued with the word next to it or stopped at it i.e.: الخَآئِنِيْنَ

    If we stop at the end of hamza we can prolong the Madd to six vowel counts i.e.: الدُّعَآءِ

    (When Hamza comes in the middle of the word):

    (المَلَائِكَةُ٬ وَالسَّآءِلِيْنَ٬ بَرِيْئُوْنَ٬ خَطِيْئَتُهُ٬ قَائِمَةٌ٬ هَنِيْئًا)


    Al-Madd Al-Muttasil المَدُّ المُتَّصِلُ (Connected Elongation)

    (When Hamza comes at the end of the word):

    (الشُّهَدَآءُ٬ وَالسَّمَآءِ٬ يُضِىءُ٬ السُّوءِ٬ قُرُوءٍ٬ تَفِىءَ)

    Exercise 1: Identify what type of Al-Madd is in the following words and practise pronouncing it with Al-Madd
    Al-Muttasil

    (جَزَآءً) (قَالَتْ) (قَالُوْا) (الَّتِي) (حَدَآئِقَ) (قِيْلَ)

    (جَآءَ) (جَآءَتِ) (الأَرَآئِكِ) (فِيْهَا) (مِنَّا)

    2. Al-Madd Al-Munfasil المَدُّ المُنْفَصِلُ (Disconnected Elongation) is when the Madd letter comes at the end of
    the first word and the Hamza comes at the beginning of the following word, and the Hamza and the Madd are in two
    different words and this is where the name ‘disconnected’ comes from i.e.: مَآ أَنْتَ
    When it comes to Al-Madd Al-Munfasil المَدُّ المُنْفَصِلُ (Disconnected Elongation), it is permissible to prolong
    the elongation letter by four to five vowel counts


    It is also permissible to shorten this Madd to two vowel counts which is known as (القَصْرِ) i.e.:
    فِيْهَآ أَبَدًا

    2.

    Al-Madd Al-Muttasil المَدُّ المُتَّصِلُ (Connected Elongation):

    (مِنَ السَّمَآءِ)


    Al-Madd Al-Munfasil المَدُّ المُنْفَصِلُ (Disconnected Elongation):

    (فِيْهَآ أَنْهَارٌ)


    b) Al-Madd Al-Munfasil المَدُّ المُنْفَصِلُ (Disconnected Elongation) Examples:

    (فِيْهَآ أَنْهَارٌ) (رَبَّنَا إِنَّنَآ ءَامَنَّا)

    ( قَالَ إِنِّي أَعْلَمُ) ( لَعَلِّي أَبْلُغُ)

    (فِي أَنْفُسِِهِمْ) (قَالُوْا أَنُؤْمِنُ )
    ( تُوْبُوْا إِلَى اللهِ) (قُوْا أَنْفُسِكُمْ)


    Exercise 1: Identify what type of Al-Madd is in the following words and practise pronouncing it with Al-Madd
    Al-Munfasil

    (كِتَابٌ) (تَقُوْلُ) (قَالُوْا ءَامَنَّ) (يَقُوْلُوْنَ) (يَا أَبِي)

    (جَآءَ) (جَآءَتِ) (الأَرَآئِكِ) (فِيْهَا) (مِنَّا)



    Example
    Madd Length
    Madd Type
    خَافَ
    2
    Al-Madd Al-Asli (Natural Elongation)

    Al-Madd Al-Far’ee المَدُّ الفَرْعِي (Secondary Elongation)
    السَّمَاءُ
    6 - 4
    Al-Madd Al-Muttasil (Connected Elongation)
    فِيْهَآ أَبَدًا
    6, 4, 2
    Al-Madd Al-Munfasil (Disconnected Elongation)



    c) Al-Madd Al-Badl المَدُّ البَدَلُ (Substituted/Changed Elongation) is when the Hamza comes before the elongation
    letter, and neither Hamza nor Sukoon comes after the elongation letter i.e.: ءَامَنَ


    When it comes to Al-Madd Al-Badl المَدُّ البَدَلُ (Substituted/Changed Elongation), it is permissible to prolong or
    shorten the elongation letter, but it is shortened to two vowel counts in Hafs recitation method i.e.: فَئَاوَى

    Examples:

    ( ءَازَرَ٬ ءَامَنَ٬ ءَادَمَ٬ ءَاتِنَا٬ ءَالِ٬ مَئَابْ)

    ( أُوْحِيَ٬ أُوْتِيَ٬ أُوْفِ٬ ءَاتِنَا٬ ءَاثَرَكَ٬ ءَايَتُكَ)

    ءَايَاتٌ٬ لِإِيْلافِ٬ خَاسِئِيْنَ٬ ءَاتَاهُمْ٬ ءَاخَرُوْنَ٬ أُوْتُوْا

    Exercise 1: Identify what type of Al-Madd is in the following words and practise pronouncing it with Al-Madd Al-Badl

    (لِيُواطِئُواْ) (ءَاسَفُوْنَا) (فَئَاتَاهُمُ) (ءَامِنِيْنَ) (رُءُوسُ)

    (بِئَايَاتِ) (وَءَاتُوْا) (مُسْتَهْزِءُوْنَ) (أَنْبِئُوْنِي) (إِيْمَانًا)

    (وَالصَّابِئُوْنَ) (وَيَسْتَنْبِئُوْنَكَ)

    Comparison of Al-Madd Al-Asli, Al-Madd Al-Mutassil and Al-Madd Al-Munfasil

    Comparison of Al-Madd Al-Badl, Al-Madd Al-Mutassil and Al-Madd Al-Munfasil

    Madd Al-Leen المَدُّ اللِّيْنُ (Soft/Easy Elongation)








    Madd Al-Leen المَدُّ اللِّيْنُ (Soft/Easy Elongation) is when (وْ) sukoon or (يْ) comes after fathah, this
    prolongation happens only when we stop.

    i.e.: الصَّيْفِ

    You have the choice of prolonging the Madd for two, four or six vowel counts when stopping on the last letter of the
    word.




    Exercise 1: Identify what the letter of Al-Madd is in the following word and practise pronouncing it with Al-Madd
    Al-Leen

    (وَالصَّيْفِ) (البَيْتَ) (خَوْفٍ)




    Exercise 2: Identify which words have Al-Madd Al-Leen

    (بِئَايَاتِ) (وَءَاتُوْا) (خَيْرٌ) (قُرَيْشٍ) (إِيْمَانًا)




    Comparison of Al-Madd Al-Badl, Al-Madd Al-Muttasil and Al-Madd Al-Munfasil:






    Comparison of Al-Madd Al-Badl, Al-Madd Al-Leen and Al-Madd Al-Asli:



    Al-Madd Al-A’aridhu Lis-Sukooni

    2d) Al-Madd Al-A’aridhu Lis-Sukooni المَدُّ العَارِضُ لِلْسُكُوْنِ (Temporary Elongation caused by Sukoon) is when a
    temporary sukoon occurs because of stopping at the end of a word with a vowel (fathah, kasrah or dhammah) which
    comes after its corresponding elongation letter

    i.e.: الرَّحْمَانُ

    Conditions that apply
    If an Alif sukoon comes after fatha
    If a Waaw sukoon comes after Dhammah or Fathah
    If a Yaa sukoon comes after Kasrah or Fathah


    When it comes to Al-Madd Al-A’aridhu Lis-Sukooni المَدُّ العَارِضُ لِلْسُكُوْنِ (Temporary Elongation caused by
    Sukoon), it is permissible to prolong the elongation letter for two, four or six vowel counts when stopping on it
    i.e.: تَعْلَمُوْنَ


    When not stopping on it, the last letter is read with a vowel and the elongation letter is prolonged to two vowel
    counts i.e.: like Al-Madd Al-Asli


    Examples:

    ( الرَّحْمَانُ٬ الإِنْسَانَ٬ خَوْفٍ٬ الغَيْبُ)

    ( نَوْمٌ٬ العَلِيْمُ٬ نَسْتَعِيْنُ٬ مَنْقُوْصٍ٬ وَالصَّيْفِ)

    Exercise 1: Practise this Madd in the following words

    ( المَوْتُ٬ ضَيْقٍ٬ طَعَامِ المِسْكِيْنِ٬ وَالبَيْتِ المَعْمُوْرِ)



    Exercise 2: Practise this Madd in the following verse

    ( إِرَمَ ذَاتِ العِمَادِ)


    Comparing Temporary Sukoon and Permanent Sukoon

    What is a Temporary sukoon?

    A temporary sukoon is a sukoon that is given to a letter that would usually be pronounced with a vowel i.e.: fathah,
    kasrah, dhammah, for example due to stopping on the word we give it a sukoon.


    i.e.: أَحَدٌ, كَافِرُوْنَ, العَصْرِ, الرَّحْمَانُ will become:



    أَحَدْ, كَافِرُوْنْ, العَصْرْ, الرَّحْمَانْ

    What is a Permanent sukoon?

    A permanent sukoon is an original sukoon, meaning the letter that takes this sukoon was not changed from a fathah,
    kasrah or dhammah to sukoon, for example the Laam in the following word. i.e.: اَلْآنُ

    Al-Madd Al-Laazim المَدُّ اللَّازِمُ (Compulsory/Mandatory Elongation)

    2 e) Al-Madd Al-Laazim المَدُّ اللَّازِمُ (Compulsory/Mandatory Elongation) is when a Madd letter comes before a
    letter with a permanent sukoon.


    In this particular Madd we will prolong the Madd letter for 6 vowel counts.


    This applies whether you continue on to the next word or stop.


    There is two types of Al-Madd Al-Laazim المَدُّ اللَّازِمُ (Compulsory/Mandatory Elongation):


    1)Word (Type)
    Light (المُخَفَّفُ)
    Heavy (المُثَقَّلُ)


    2) Letter (Type)
    Light (المُخَفَّفُ)
    Heavy (المُثَقَّلُ)



    Before we learn Al-Madd Al-Laazim, we must first understand the difference between a stressed letter and a
    non-stressed letter.

    A Stressed letter refers to a letter with a Shaddah.

    For example: مُحَمَّدٌ in this example we stress the meem.

    Another example is: الحَقُّ

    A Non-Stressed letter refers to a letter without Shaddah.


    We will first look at Madd Al-Laazim Al-Kalimi Al-Mukhaffafu المَدُّ اللَّازِمُ الكَلِمِي المُخَفَّفُ (Light
    Compulsory/Mandatory Elongation in a Word)

    When it comes to Madd Al-Laazim Al-Kalimi Al-Mukhaffafu المَدُّ اللَّازِمُ الكَلِمِي المُخَفَّفُ (Light
    Compulsory/Mandatory Elongation in a Word), the Madd letter will come before a non-stressed letter that has a
    permanent sukoon.

    For example: ءَآلْآنَ

    This Madd must be prolonged for six vowel counts whether continuing or stopping on the word


    There are only two examples of Madd Al-Laazim Al-Kalimi Al-Mukhaffafu المَدُّ اللَّازِمُ الكَلِمِي المُخَفَّفُ
    (Light Compulsory/Mandatory Elongation in a Word) found in the Qur’aan.

    (ءَآلْآنَ وَقَدْ كُنْتُمْ بِهِ تَسْتَعْجِلُوْنَ)
    (ءَآلْآنَ وَقَدْ عَصَيْتَ قَبْلُ وَكُنْتَ مِنَ المُفْسِدِيْنَ )
    Comparing Al-Madd Al-A’aridhu Lis-Sukooni and Al-Madd Al-Laazim Al-Kalimi Al-Mukhaffaf



    Madd Al-Laazim Al-Kalimi Al-Muthaqqalu المَدُّ اللَّازِمُ الكَلِمِي المُثَقَّلُ (Heavy Compulsory/Mandatory
    Elongation in a Word)


    When it comes to Madd Al-Laazim Al-Kalimi Al-Muthaqqalu المَدُّ اللَّازِمُ الكَلِمِي المُثَقَّلُ (Heavy
    Compulsory/Mandatory Elongation in a Word), the Madd letter comes before a stressed letter i.e.: letter with a
    Shaddah.


    For example: وَلَا الضَّآلِّيْنَ


    This Madd must be prolonged for six vowel counts whether continuing or stopping on the word

    There are many examples in the Qur’aan:

    ( الضَّآلِّيْنَ، الحَآقَّةُ، الصَّآخَّةُ، الطَّآمَّةُ) ( كَآفَّةً، العَآدِّيْنَ، يُوَآدُّوْنَ)

    (الصَّآفَّاتِ، صَوَآفَّ، حَآجَّكَ، أَتُحَآجُّوْنَنَا)


    Exercise 1: Practise applying the Madd in the following words.

    ( شَآقُّوْا اللهَ، دَآبَّةُ، بِضَآرِّيْنَ، جَآنٌّ، ءَآمِّيْنَ)

    Exercise 2: Practise applying the Madd in the following words.

    ( يُحَآدُّوْنَ، تُشَآقُّوْنَ، تَتَّبِعَآنِّ)

    Al-Huroof Al-Muqatta’ (الحُرُوْفُ المُقَطَّعَةُ)
    The Disjointed Letters

    The disjointed letters are the letters which some Surahs in the Qur’aan begin with; from the 14 letters mentioned
    below found in 29 different Surahs:

    1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
    ن - ص - ح - ك - ي - م - ق - ط - ع - ا - ل
    12 13 14
    ه - س - ر


    These letters may be memorised using the following phrase:

    نَصٌّ حَكِيْمٌ قَطْعًا لَهُ سِرٌّ (which means: “Definitely it is a text which has a wise meaning.”)


    The Disjointed letters can be divided into three groups:

    1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14
    ن - ص - ح - ك - ي - م - ق - ط - ع - ا - ل - ه - س - ر


    Group 1 - Without any Madd i.e.: ا will never be read with a Madd - الم


    Group 2 - Natural Madd (two vowel counts): ح - ي - ط - ه - ر


    Group 3 - Madd of 6 vowel counts: ن - ص - ك - م - ق - ع - ل - س

    Group 2 - Natural Madd (two vowel counts): ح - ي - ط - ه - ر can be remembered by the words حَيٌّ طَهْرٌ which means
    alive and pure

    The following letters are made up of two letters i.e.:

    ح = حَا

    ي = يَا


    ط = طَا

    ه = هَا

    ر = رَا


    How do we apply the Madd to the Disjointed letters that are broken into two letters
    The Madd rule that we will apply is the Natural Madd

    Recap of Natural Madd: If you have an Alif sukoon and before it comes a fathah or Yaa sukoon and before it comes a
    kasrah and Waaw sukoon and before it comes dhammah
    Examples- How would we recite ي


    Break down the Disjointed Letter: ي - ا : يَا
    Identify the Madd letter: اْ
    Identify the Madd rule: Alif sukoon and before it comes a fathah, so we will apply two vowel counts




    Example 2: طه

    Both ط and ه is a Disjointed Letter; that falls into the category of Group 2 (Which means that they’re broken down
    into two letters)


    So, it is broken down into the following: طَاْ) ط - ا = ط) and هَاْ) ه - ا = ه)
    (Altogether = طاْهَاْ)
    Identify the Madd letter: اْ(Which appears twice)
    Identify the Madd rule: Alif sukoon and before it comes a fathah, so we will apply two vowel counts for each Madd
    letter

    Group 3 - Madd of 6 vowel counts:ن - ص - ك - م - ق - ع - ل - س can be remembered by the words نَقْصٌ عَسْلُكُمْ
    which means your honey is and pure

    The following letters are made up of three letters i.e.:

    ن = نُوْنْ


    ص = صَاْدْ


    ك = كَاْفْ


    م = مِيْمْ

    ق = قَاْفْ


    ع = عَيْنْ


    ل = لَاْمْ


    س = سِيْنْ


    An example from the Qur’aan: ن

    How do we apply the Madd to the Disjointed letters that are broken into three letters
    The Madd rule that we will apply is a Madd of six vowel counts If you have an Alif sukoon and before it comes a
    fathah or Yaa sukoon and before it comes a kasrah/fathah or Waaw sukoon and before it comes dhammah/fathah and the
    last letter has an original sukoon

    Examples- How would we recite ق
    Break down the Disjointed Letter: ق - ا - ف : قَاْفْ


    Identify the Madd letter: اْ
    Identify the Madd rule: Alif sukoon came after fathah and the last letter has an original sukoon
    , so we will apply six vowel counts


    Example 2: ص



    So, it is broken down into the following:صَاْدْ : ص - ا -د
    Identify the Madd letter: اْ
    Identify the Madd rule: Alif sukoon came after fathah and the last letter has an original sukoon
    , so we will apply six vowel counts



    Disjointed Letters from the Qur’aan:

    ن


    يس


    ص


    حم عسق


    Disjointed Letters from the Qur’aan: Exercise: Break down the Disjointed Letters, Identify the Madd letter and the
    Rule to apply

    آلم
    الر
    المر



    Madd Al-Laazim Al-Harfi Al-Mukhaffafu


    2 e) Madd Al-Laazim Al-Harfi Al-Mukhaffafu المَدُّ اللَّازِمُ الحَرْفِي المُخَفَّفُ (Light Compulsory/Mandatory
    Elongation in a Letter) will be applied whenever a Disjointed Letter comes such as ق where its’ middle letter is a
    Madd letter which happens to come before a soft letter with a permanent sukoon that cannot be merged. (ق = ق-ا-ف)
    (So like we saw before; if we break down ق we will get قَاْفْ)


    In this particular Madd; we must prolong the Madd letter for 6 vowel counts.


    This applies whether you continue onto the next word or stop.

    Examples:

    (ص وَالقُرْآنِ ذِى الذِّكْرِ) <-(صَاْدْ) (ن وَالقَلَمِ وَمَا يَسْطُرُوْنَ) <-(نُوْنْ) Note: We will not prolong Alif
        at the beginning in any case whatsoever. Exercises: Recite the following verses below and mention where you
        applied the Madd and why. (حم وَالكِتَابِ المُبِيْنِ) (الر كِتَابٌ أَنْزَلْنَاهُ) Madd Al-Laazim Al-Harfi
        Al-Muthaqqalu 2. e) Madd Al-Laazim Al-Harfi Al-Muthaqqalu المَدُّ اللَّازِمُ الحَرْفِي المُثَقَّلُ (Heavy
        Compulsory/Mandatory Elongation in a Letter) will be applied whenever a Disjointed Letter comes such as ل where
        its’ middle letter is a Madd/Leen letter which happens to come before a letter with a permanent sukoon that will
        then be merged with the letter coming after it i.e.: الم when broken down it consists of 9 letters:
        ا-ل-ف-ل-ا-م-م-ي-م (So like we saw before; if we break down لم we will get لَاْمْ مِّيْمْ) In this particular
        Madd; we must prolong the Madd letter for 6 vowel counts and apply Idghaam. This applies whether you continue
        onto the next word or stop. Examples: طسم -> طَا سِيْنْ مِّيْمْ


        الم -> اَلِفْ لَاْمْ مِّيْمْ

        Madd As-Silah مَدُّ الصِّلَةِ (Connecting Elongation)


        Madd As-Silah مَدُّ الصِّلَةِ (Connecting Elongation) relates to a rule in Arabic Grammar, so we will not look
        at it in depth to avoid any confusion.

        It has two types:


        Madd As-Silah As-Sughraa مَدُّ الصِّلَةِ الصُّغْرَى (The Minor Connecting Elongation)
        Madd As-Silah Al-Kubraa مَدُّ الصِّلَةِ الكُبْرَى (The Major Connecting Elongation)

        Madd As-Silah As-Sughraa مَدُّ الصِّلَةِ الصُّغْرَى (The Minor Connecting Elongation) is generally when the
        letter ه is in the middle of two voweled letters as shown below.

        Example 1:

        In this example, notice how the letter ه comes after لَ and before صَ

        When do we apply this Madd?


        Generally when the letter ه is in between two voweled letters.
        If condition 1 applies, ه must have a dhammah or kasrah (Not fathah) and it must be connected to the previous
        letter.
        ه must be an additional letter added to the original make-up of the word (meaning the word existed before we add
        ه) i.e.: ...فِي،مِنْ.
        How do we apply this Madd?


        If the letter ه has a dhammah, we will prolong it until it sounds like a waaw at the end.

        If the letter ه has a kasrah, we will prolong it until it sounds like a yaa at the end

        Example 2:

        In this example, although the letter ه does not come after a letter with a vowel, it comes before مُ

        When do we apply this Madd?
        Generally when the letter ه is in between two voweled letters.
        If condition 1 applies, ه must have a dhammah or kasrah (Not fathah)

        If the letter ه has a dhammah, we will prolong it until it sounds like a waaw at the end

        If the letter ه has a kasrah, we will prolong it until it sounds like a yaa at the end




        How do we recognise this Madd?

        If the conditions are met and the ه has a dhammah, we will see a small waaw written next to it i.e.:

        If the conditions are met and the ه has a kasrah, we will see a small yaa written next to it i.e.:



        How long will we prolong this Madd for?


        We will prolong the ه for 2 vowel counts only if we continue, so if we stop on the ه; there will not be any Madd
        and ه will be pronounced with a sukoon.



        Exercises: Recite the words below and apply the Minor Connecting Madd, describe where the Minor Connecting Madd
        is and explain why you had to apply it.






        What are the exceptions for this Madd?


        We will not apply this Madd when there is a Hamza coming after ه i.e.:




        We will not apply the Madd in the following examples as they’re exceptions to the rule:


        We will apply the Madd in the following example where ه is used for the feminine هَذَا i.e.:




        Madd As-Silah Al-Kubraa مَدُّ الصِّلَةِ الكُبْرَى (The Major Connecting Elongation)

        is and explain why you had to apply it.





        Bonus Exercise: Recite the words below applying the Madd, describe what type of Madd will be applied and explain
        why you had to apply it.






        Madd At-Tamkeen مَدُّ التَّمْكِيْنِ (Enabled Elongation)




        This Madd occurs if either two ي come next to each other in the middle of one word or two و come next to each
        other in the middle of one word.


        This Madd is called At-Tamkeen, because the first of its letter (يِّ or وُ) enabled the second of its letter to
        be prolonged


        A يْ comes after a يِّ with a stressed kasrah


        The second ي will be prolonged

        Examples:


        This Madd is called At-Tamkeen, because the first of its letter (ي or و) enabled the second of its letter to be
        prolonged


        A وْ comes after a وُ


        The second و will be prolonged

        Example:


        How will we recognise this Madd?

        Usually a little yaa will show next to the “stressed” yaa (with shaddah) that has kasrah or a little waaw after
        the waaw with dhammah



        دَاوُودُ

        How long will the Madd be prolonged?

        If we do not stop on the word, the Madd will be prolonged for 2 vowel counts


        If we stop at the end of the word, the Madd will be prolonged for 4 or 5 vowel counts
        The following two examples of Madd At-Tamkeen are exceptional, since the first وْ comes after a letter with
        Dhammah and the next و has a vowel i.e.: fathah (in these two examples)


        In order to avoid the Idghaam between two of the ( و ), we will only apply Madd Al-Asli (Natural Madd) i.e.: 2
        vowel counts.




        Exercises: Identify which Madd exist in the following words and explain the rule that will be applied and how
        many vowel counts the Madd will take.

        حُيِّيْتُمْدَ اوُودُ








        Al-Madd Al-’Iwadh مَدُّ العِوَضِ (Compensating Elongation)




        This Madd occurs only at the end of a word that has fathahtain (Two fathahs).


        It replaces the fathahtain for a lengthened ا with a fathah when stopping on the word.


        It is only prolonged when stopped on, but if you continue reciting; the fathatain will be pronounced instead.

        This Madd will be prolonged for only two vowel counts.

        Examples:
