    مَخَارِجُ الْحُرُوفِ - Exiting Place Of Letters


    What is Makhaarij Al-Huroof?


    It is the place from which the sound of each Arabic letter originates i.e.: the throat, the lips, etc

    There are 5 exiting points of which the Arabic letters come from as shown below:
    Al-Jawf: the empty space in the chest through the throat and mouth
    Al-Halq: the throat
    Al-Lisaan: the tongue
    Ash-Shafataan: the two lips
    Al-Khayshoom: the nose or nasal passage







    How to recognise where a letter is coming from?
    If you make any letter saakin (non-voweled) and put a voweled letter in front of it, you will notice where this
    letter is coming from.

    For example: ب
    If we place (اَ) in front of (ب) i.e.: اَبْ

    You will notice that the letter (ب) comes from your two lips.









    Al-Jawf الْجَوف


    Al-Jawf: this is the empty space in the chest area. There are 3 letters that come from here. The 3 letters are:
    ي ا و
    How to identify the letters of Al-Jawf?
    The above 3 letters must be Saakin. This means they must have a Sukoon.
    The و (Waaw) must be Saakin and the previous letter must have a Dhammah (ُ ُ ) قُولُوا.
    The ا (Alif) must be Saakin and the previous letter must have a Fathah (َ َ ) قَالَ.
    The ي (Yaa) must be Saakin and the previous letter must have a Kasrah (ِ ِ ) قِيلَ.

    These three letters are also known as the Madd letters and are lengthened or stretched for a minimum of 2 Harakahs
    (around 1.5 seconds)














    How to pronounce Al-Jawf?

    We have to lengthen or stretch the letter for a minimum of 2 Harakahs (around 1.5 seconds)



    Examples of Jawf:

    Example of Waaw: قُولُوا
    Example of Alif: قَالَ
    Example of Yaa: قِيلَ
    Exercise 1: Practise pronouncing the following words and describe what you noticed when pronouncing the و ? (Hint:
    where do you feel the vibration coming from)

    قُولُوا تُوْبُوْا يَقُوْلُ

    تَقُوْلُ أَقُوْلُ نَقُوْلُ


    يَقُوْلُوْنَ أَعُوْذُ نَعُوْذُ



    Exercise 2: Practise pronouncing the following words and describe what you noticed when pronouncing the ا ? (Hint:
    where do you feel the vibration coming from)

    قَالَ تَابَ رَانَ

    خالِدٌ اِسْتِعَاذَةٌ الرَّحْمَانُ


    مَالِكِ إِيَاكَ صِرَاطَ






    Exercise 3: Practise pronouncing the following words and describe what you noticed when pronouncing the ي ? (Hint:
    where do you feel the vibration coming from)

    قِيلَ الرَّحِيْمِ نَسْتَعِيْنَ

    فِيْ مُتَّقِيْن سَكِيْنَة

    مِيْم يَتِيْم التِّيْنِ






    Exercise 4: Practise pronouncing the following words and explain which of them would be grouped in Al-Jawf and why?
    (Hint: where do you feel the vibration coming from)

    تُوْبُوْا جِنٌّ يَسْتَعِيْنُ

    كَتَبَ إِلَى مَنْ


    كُتِبَ مِنْ إِنْسَانٌ



    Al-Halq الْحَلْقُ

    Al-Halq: The Throat. In the throat we have 3 exits and 6 letters.

    خ غ ح ع ه ء

    Throat exits and letters:
    Top of the throat:
    غ,خ
    Middle of the throat: ع,ح
    bottom of the throat: ء,ه

    As we previously learned there are two groups of letters:
    Heavy letters
    Light letters.


    There are only two heavy letters coming from the throat: خ and غ regardless if they are voweled (غَ غِ غُ) (خَ خِ
    خُ) or non-voweled (خْ) (غْ) they will remain heavy.


    If we make خ or غ saakin and put a voweled letter in front of it, we will notice that they come from the top of the
    throat.

    For example:
    أَخْ and أَغْ
    The remaining letters coming from the throat: ء,ه,ع,ح will remain light; regardless if they are voweled or
    non-voweled.
    If we make ع or ح saakin and put a voweled letter in front of it, we will notice that they both come from the middle
    of the throat.

    For example:

    أَحْ and أَعْ
    If we make ه or ء saakin and put a voweled letter in front of it, we will notice that they both come from the lowest
    part of the throat.

    For example:

    أَهْ and يَأْ

    Exercise 1: Practise pronouncing the following words and describe what you noticed when pronouncing the خ ? (Hint:

    أَبَدًا أَبٌ يَأْكُلُ

    إِبْلِيْس أُصَلِّي أُمَارِّسُ
    إِنْ إِلَى إِنِّي

    Exercise 6: Practise pronouncing the following words and describe what you noticed when pronouncing the ه ? (Hint:

    هَلْ هُنَا الهَاكُمُ

    الحَمْدُ للَّهِ هُمْ فَوْقَهَا


    اِهْدِنَا هُدَى أَنْفُسِهِمْ


    Al-Lisaan اللِّسَانُ

    Al-Lisaan: the Tongue. In the tongue we have 4 areas, 10 exits and 18 letters in total.

    Areas of tongue:
    Back of the tongue: ق1 , ك2
    Middle of the tongue: ج3 , ش3 , ي3
    Edges & sides of the tongue: ض4 , ل5
    Tip of the tongue: ن6 , ر7 , ت8 , د8 , ط8 , س9 , ص9 , ز9 , ث10 , ذ10 , ظ10











    In totality, there are three groups of letters:
    Heavy letters
    Light letters
    Letters that are heavy only in certain conditions and light only in certain conditions

    There are five letters coming from the tongue that will always be heavy:
    ق، ص، ض، ط، ظ

    So, whether they have fathah, dhammah or kasrah; they will remain heavy.

    There are only eleven letters coming from the tongue that will always be light:
    ك، ش، ج، ي، ن، ت، د، ذ، س، ز، ث
    So, whether they have fathah, dhammah or kasrah; they will remain light.


    The remaining two letters coming from the tongue: ل and ر will be either: heavy or light depending on the situation
    which we learned before i.e.: the Laam in الله has several conditions and the Raa has several conditions too



    1. (The Back Of The Tongue)
    If we make ق or ك saakin and put a voweled letter in front of it, we will notice that they both come from the back
    of the tongue.

    2. (The Middle Of The Tongue)
    If we make ج or ش or ي saakin and put a voweled letter in front of any of them, we will notice that they come from
    the middle of the tongue.

    For example:

    أَشْ and أَجْ and أَيْ

    3. (The Edges/Sides Of The Tongue)
    If we make ل or ض saakin and put a voweled letter in front of any of them, we will notice that they come from the
    edges/sides of the tongue.

    For example:
    أَلْ and أَضْ


    4. (The Tip Of The Tongue)
    If we make [ن، ر، ت، ذ، د، ث، ظ، ط، س، ص، ز] saakin and put a voweled letter in front of any of them, we will notice
    that we use the tip of the tongue.
    For example:

    Ash-Shafataan/Ash-Shafatain الشَّفَتَيْنِ/الشَّفَتَانِ

    Ash-Shafataan: the 2 lips. On the 2 lips we have 2 exits and 4 letters in total.
    Exits on lips:
    The two lips together: ب , م , و
    The bottom lip with the front upper teeth: ف

    All letters coming from the lips: ب,م,ف and و regardless if they are voweled or

    non-voweled (بَ بِ بُ بْ) (وَ وِ وُ وْ) (فَ فِ فُ فْ) and ( مْ مَ مِ مُ) they will remain light.

    If we make و or ب or م saakin and put a voweled letter in front of it, we will notice that they come from the two
    lips, however; the sound of ب and م are produced from the two lips pressing and we round our two lips to produce the
    sound of و.

    For example:

    أَبْ أَوْ أَمْ


    If we make ف saakin and put a voweled letter in front of it, we will notice that it comes from the top front teeth
    touching the bottom lip.

    For example:

    أَفْ

    وُسِطَ وُقُوْفٌ وِلْيَمُ


    Exercise 3: Practise pronouncing the following words and describe what you noticed when pronouncing the م ? (Hint:

    فَاعْلَمْ فُعُوْلٌ فِيْهَا



    Al-Khayshoom الْخَيشُوم

    Al-Khayshoom refers to the nasal passage where the Ghunnah “Nasal Sound” (the attribute for the letters ن and م)
    comes from. There are no letters that come from this exit place, however, its considered an exit place due to it
    being used a lot in the recitation of The Qur’aan.






    If we give ن or م Shaddah, we will notice a vibration sound coming from our nose; this characteristic is called
    الغُنَّةُ “The Nasal Sound”. Whether either of these two letters has Shaddah or not, this characteristic will be
    present; as it is part of both ن or م.

    For example:
    إِمَّا and أَنَّا
    It is important to know that no other letter is associated with this exit place; so it is incorrect to pronounce any
    other letter from Al-Khayshoom “The Nasal Passage”.

    We must make sure that when we recite The Qur’aan; that we apply the Nasal Sound only to ن and م.


    Exercise 1: Practise pronouncing the following words and describe what you noticed when pronouncing the ن ? (Hint:
    where do you feel the vibration sound coming from)

    إِنَّ إِنَّا إِنِّي
    أَنَّ أَنِّي أَنَّكُمْ
    إِنْ أَنْ الغُنَّةُ


    Exercise 2: Practise pronouncing the following words and describe what you noticed when pronouncing the م ? (Hint:
    where do you feel the vibration sound coming from)

    أَمَّا عَمَّ إِمَّا
    لَمَّا مِنْ مَّا عَلَيْهِمْ مُؤْصَدَة
    عَمٌّ عَمْ فَأَمَّا
