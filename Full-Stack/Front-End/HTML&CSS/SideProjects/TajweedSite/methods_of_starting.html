    The Different types of Starting

    There are only two types of starting (الإِبْتِدَاءُ):

    (The Optional Start) الإِخْتِيَارِيّ:

    This is the starting that is out of choice which has three acceptable ways and one unacceptable way. (For your
    level, it is best to start from the beginning of a verse and stop based on the signs we learned above until you
    learn Arabic.)


    (The Examining Start) الإِخْتِبَارِي:


    This is the starting that occurs during an exam; when being tested where the Sheikh may ask you to start in a
    particular verse.
