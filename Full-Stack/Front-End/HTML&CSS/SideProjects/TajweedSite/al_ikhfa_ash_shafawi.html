    Ikhfa الإِخْفاَءُ الشَّفَوِي (Labial Hiding/Concealment)

    This is when you hide the Meem Saakinah coming immediately before baa.

    How to pronounce the Ikhfa rule:

    The sound of the meem is hidden and the lips are shaped, ready to pronounce the baa.
    Do not press your two lips together completely [as you would if you were to pronounce a full meem]. Leave a small
    gap of space and let the sound of the meem come from the deeper part of your mouth while you prepare to say the baa.
    By letting the meem come from the inner mouth, its’ sound stays encapsulated behind the teeth, and so the meem is
    hidden. Remember that this rule is carried out for two counts.



    You will only apply this rule if the Meem Saakinah is at the end of the first word and the baa is at the beginning
    of the second word.

    The sound of Ikhfa is such that we make ghunnah (nasal sound)

    Point of indication: You may find it easier to find this rule in your mushaf if your mushaf does not show a sukoon
    on the first meem

    The Letter of Al-Ikhfa Ash-Shafawi: ب
