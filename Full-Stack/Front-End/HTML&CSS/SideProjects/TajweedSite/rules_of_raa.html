    Seven Situations When Raa will be Heavy


    Raa can sometimes be pronounced light and sometimes heavy, this all depends on its conditions.


    Note: One must pay close attention to the following eight heavy conditions that apply to the letter Raa.



    Raa will be pronounced with Tafkheem (Heaviness) if it has a fatha i.e:

    (رَمَضَان , رَحْمَةِ رَبِّكَ)


    Raa will be pronounced with Tafkheem (Heaviness) if it has a dhammah i.e:

    (كَفَرُوْا , تَبَرُّوْا وَتَتَّقُوْا , رُوْحُ القُدُسِ , رُحَمَاءُ)


    3) Raa will be pronounced with Tafkheem (Heaviness) if it has a sukoon and the letter befores has a fatha i.e:

    (أَرْسَلْنَا , أَرْبَعِيْنَ , مَرْجِعُكُمْ)


    4) Raa will be pronounced with Tafkheem (Heaviness) if it has a sukoon and the letter befores has a dhammah i.e:

    (المُرْسَلُوْنَ , وَقُرْءَانٍ , بِقُرْبَانٍ)


    5) Raa will be pronounced with Tafkheem (Heaviness) if it is a “saakin” non-voweled letter and a hamzatul wasl comes
    immediately before it i.e:

    اِرْجِعِي إِلَى رَبِّكِ , ارْجِعُوْا , ارْكَعُوْا , اِرْكَبُوْا, إِنِ ارْتَبْتُمْ

    أَمِ ارْتَابُوْا , لِمَنِ ارْتَضَى

    6) Raa will be pronounced with Tafkheem (Heaviness) if it is a “saakin” non-voweled letter and the letter after raa
    is an elevation letter that has not got a kasrah and the letter before raa has an original kasrah in the same word
    i.e:

    (إِرْصَادًا , مِرْصَادًا , فِرْقَة , قِرْطَاس)


    7) Raa will be pronounced with Tafkheem (Heaviness) when it is a “saakin” letter due to “waqf” stopping and the
    letter coming before it is also a “saakin” letter and immediately before it is a fatha or dhammah i.e:

    (الفَجْرْ, العَصْرْ, الوَتْرْ, الصَّخْرْ, خُسْرْ)


    Five Situations when Raa will be light


    Note: One must pay close attention to the following 5 light conditions that apply to the letter Raa.



    Raa will be pronounced with Tarqeeq (Lightness) if it has a kasrah i.e.:

    (رِجَالٌ , فَرِحَ المُخَلَّفُوْنَ)


    Raa will be pronounced with Tarqeeq (Lightness) if it comes after a kasrah i.e:
    (فِرْعَوْنَ , وَاصْبِرْ , لَشِرْذِمَةٌ)


    Raa will be pronounced with Tarqeeq (Lightness) if it becomes “saakin” due to “waqf” and before it came a yaa
    saakinah i.e.:
    (خَطِيْرْ, كَبِيْرْ, خَبِيْرْ)


    Raa will be pronounced with Tarqeeq (Lightness) if it is a “saakin” non-voweled letter and the letter before raa is
    an elevation letter that has not got a (dhammah or fatha) i.e.:

    (مِصْرْ , قِطْرْ)


    Raa will be pronounced with Tarqeeq (Lightness) when it comes before a small Alif in a word where the fatha is in
    between a fatha and kasrah and the alif in between an alif and a yaa and this occurs only once in the Qur’aan in
