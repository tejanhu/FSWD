    الْإِسْتِعَاذَةُ Al-Isti’aathah


    Meaning: أَعُوْذُ بِاللٌّهِ مِنَ الشَّيْطَانِ الرَّجِيمِ (I seek refuge in Allah from Shaitaan the accursed)
    Whoever wants to recite from the Qur’aan must recite Al-Isti’aathah because Allah commanded us in the Qur’aan in
    Surat An-Nahl verse 98: {فَإِذَا قَرَأْتَ الْقُرْآنَ فَاسْتَعِذْ بِاللَّهِ مِنَ الشَّيْطَانِ الرَّجِيمِ}
    “When you recite the Qur’aan, seek refuge with Allah from Shaitaan, the accursed”


    There are three places where one may say it quietly to oneself
    When you recite the Qur’aan (outside the prayer)
    When you recite the Qur’aan while in the prayer
    When you recite the Qur’aan within a group of people who are learning or reciting the Qur’aan and you are not the
    first to read

    There are two places where one may say it loudly
    When you’re the first to recite the Qur’aan and someone is listening to you
    When you recite the Qur’aan within a group of people who are learning or reciting the Qur’aan and you are the first
    to read
