    Al-Ith’har Ash-Shafawi الإِظْهَارُ الشَّفَوِي (To recite clear)


    This is when you pronounce the Meem Saakinah clearly without any form of merging or hiding when any of the remaining
    letters come immediately after Meem Saakinah.

    If waaw or fa comes after Meem Saakinah, one should emphasise reciting it clearly to avoid confusing the listener
    that a baa was recited.

    This rule will apply whether any of the following letters comes after Meem Saakinah in one word or two words.

    The Remaining 26 Letters:
