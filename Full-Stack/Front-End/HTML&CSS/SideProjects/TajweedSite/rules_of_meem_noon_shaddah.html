    The Rules Of Meem & Noon With Shaddah

    Whenever you find a Noon ( ن ) or Meem ( م ) with a shaddah on it i.e.: (نّ , مّ) it must be read with Ghunnah and
    this should never stretch longer than two “harakah” vowel counts i.e.: (pronouncing a voweled letter twice).


    A letter with shaddah; symbolises two letters, the first letter with sukoon and the second letter with a “harakah”
    (fatha, dhammah, kasrah)


    The letter with sukoon merges with the “mutaharik” voweled letter; pronouncing them like one letter making a Shaddah

    Examples:


    لَمْ + مَّا = لَمَّا
    ثُمْ + مَّ = ثُمَّ
    إِنْ + نَ = إِنَّ

    The shaddah makes it easier to recognise the same letter is being pronounced in one word without having to write the
    letter again

    Note:
    The meem or noon that comes with a shaddah can be found either in the middle or end of a word.
