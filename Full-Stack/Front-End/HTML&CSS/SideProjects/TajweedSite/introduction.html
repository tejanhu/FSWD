        <p> Tajweed is giving every letter of the Qur’aan its due right and characteristics whilst observing the rules
            that
            apply to those letters when reciting the Qur’aan.</p>
        <h2 class="under_title">What is the reward of perfecting your Tajweed?</h2>
        <p>The prophet Peace and blessings be upon him said: (Indeed the one who recites the Qur’aan beautifully,
            smoothly,
            and
            precisely, will be in the company of the noble and obedient angels. As for the one who recites with
            difficulty,
            stammering or stumbling through its verses, then he will have twice that reward.)</p>
        <h2 class="under_title"> Why learn Tajweed?</h2>
        <p> To recite the Qur’aan as close as possible to the way the prophet Muhammad Peace and blessings be upon him
            recited.
            The Prophet Muhammad Peace and blessings be upon him said: (the best of you are those who learn the Quran
            and
            teach
            it)</p>
