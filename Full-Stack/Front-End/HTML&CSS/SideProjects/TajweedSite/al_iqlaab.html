    2. Iqlaab/Qalb الإِقْلَابُ/القَلْبُ (The Changing)


    This is when the noon saakinah/tanween comes immediately before the letter ب, so you change the noon
    saakinah/tanween into the letter م.

    How to pronounce the rule of Iqlaab:

    During recitation of Qur’aan, whenever you come across the letter Noon or a Tanween followed by the letter Baa, you
    will not pronounce them, rather you will change the noon sound into that of a Meem Sakinah with Ghunnah.

    Also you should not close your lips completely stressing them nor open them widely during pronunciation of this
    Meem, but you should make a small gap between your lips to give the sound of Ghunnah.
