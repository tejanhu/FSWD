    Noon Saakinah & Tanween Rules

    Noon Saakinah refers to a Noon that is vowelless which appears in either the middle or the end of a word.


    It is pronounced clearly whether reading or writing while continuing or stopping


    The sign of “sukoon” is ( ْ )


    Tanween is pronounced like a hidden noon “saakinah”, but written with a double fathah/kasrah/dhammah at the end of
    the last letter of a word


    The sign of “tanween” i.e: بًا بٍ بٌ


    If we stop on the female taa ( ةً ) with tanween i.e.: خَاشِعَةً then we will drop the tanween and recite it like
    the following: خَاشِعَهْ

    Note: All Noon saakinah rules apply to Tanween.



    There are 4 main rules for Noon Saakinah and Tanween
