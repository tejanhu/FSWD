    3. Ikhfa الإِخْفاَءُ (The Hiding/Concealment)

    This is when you hide the Noon Saakinah/Tanween coming immediately before any of the letters of Ikhfa.
    The sound of Ikhfa is in between Idgham and Ith’har


    The Letters of Ikhfa:

    ت ث ج د ذ ز س ش ص ض ط ظ ف ق ك



    How to pronounce the rule of Ikhfa:

    To hide the letter Noon or tanween; your tongue must not touch the teeth or gum, instead your tongue moves close to,
    but not directly on the exiting place of the next letter, which is the letter causing the Ikhfa (hiding).

    Then you hold this sound with an accompanying Ghunnah (nasal sound) for the amount of time suitable for the Ikhfa.
    The technique of the Ikhfa of the Noon takes practice to grasp. There is no difference in the Ikhfa or in the
    technique of the Ikhfa whether it is a written Noon that is being hidden, or a tanween.

    Common Mistakes:
    Some students simply keep their tongue at the exiting place of the letter Noon during the Ikhfa, and prolong the
    sound with a Ghunnah (nasal sound).
    Another mistake is to let the back part of the tongue come up to the roof of the mouth and rest it there. The tongue
    shouldn’t be touching the roof, gums, or teeth, rather the tongue should be near to the exiting place of the next
    letter, as mentioned previously.



    Examples of the Ikhfa of the Noon saakinah and tanween:

    In this example above, there is a Noon saakinah in the middle of the second word, followed by the letter , one of
    the letters of Ikhfa. You don’t let your tongue touch the exiting point of the Noon, rather put your tongue in a
    position near to, but not touching the exiting place of the letter , and hold this sound with a Ghunnah for a period
    of time. The exact period of time cannot be explained in writing, but instead should be learned and copied from a
    qualified Qur’an teacher. It is not correct to state that the Ghunnah is held for two counts.

    In this example there is a tanween at the end of the second word, followed by a as the first letter of the next
    following word. The is one of the letters that causes hiding of the Noon saakinah and tanween. The technique is
    similar to that described above, except our tongue should get close to the articulation point of the instead of the
    .

    This aayah has a Noon saakinah as the last letter of the first word, it is followed by a , which is one of the
    letters that causes the hiding of the Noon saakinah. Again, as previously stated, you don’t let your tongue go to
    the exiting place of the Noon, but instead bring your tongue near to, but not touching, the , and hold the sound
    with an accompanying Ghunnah for the appropriate period of time.
