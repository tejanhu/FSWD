      The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus gallus domesticus),
      <b>a subspecies of the red junglefowl, is a type of domesticated fowl</b>,
      originally from Southeastern Asia. Rooster or cock is a term for an adult
      male bird. A younger male may be called a cockerel; a male that has been
      castrated is a capon. The adult female bird is called a hen. "Chicken" was
      originally a term only for an immature, or at least young, bird, but
      thanks to its usage on restaurant menus has now become the most common
      term for the subspecies in general, especially in American English. In
      older sources common fowl or domestic fowl were typically used for this.
      Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies, chickens
      were not kept for food until the Hellenistic period (4th–2nd centuries
      BCE).<sup>[1]</sup><sup>[2]</sup> Humans now keep chickens primarily as a
      source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) and as pets. Chickens
      are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total
      population of 23.7 billion as of 2018,<sup>[3]</sup> up from more than 19
      billion in 2011.<sup>[4]</sup> There are more chickens in the world than
      any other bird.<sup>[4]</sup> There are numerous cultural references to
      chickens – in myth, folklore and religion, and in language and literature.

      Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origins in South Asia,
      Southeast Asia, and East Asia,[5] but the clade found in the Americas,
      Europe, the Middle East and Africa originated from the Indian
      subcontinent. From ancient India, the chicken spread to Lydia in western
      Asia Minor, and to Greece by the 5th century BCE.[6] Fowl have been known
      in Egypt since the mid-15th century BCE, with the "bird that gives birth
      every day" having come from the land between Syria and Shinar, Babylonia,
      according to the annals of Thutmose III.[
